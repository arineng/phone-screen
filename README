The goal of this exercise is to get all tests to pass modifying only code in the net.arin.phonescreen.exercises package.

The first exercise tests knowledge of equality in Java. The second tests knowledge of class and interface inheritance.

For the first exercise, look at the code in the  net.arin.phonescreen.exercises.equality package marked:
"TODO: Exercise 1".
Make the modifications requested so that all tests in the SomeBeanEqualityTest class pass.

For the second exercise, look at the code in the  net.arin.phonescreen.exercises.inheritance package marked:
"TODO: Exercise 2".
Make the modifications requested so that all tests in the InheritanceTest class pass.

Assuming you have maven installed, run the tests from the project root directory by typing:
mvn clean test

You'll need an internet connection the first time so that maven can download dependencies.

You'll also need Java 1.6 or better to run this code. I believe it will work with a small change on Java 1.5. Bonus points if you can tell me what that change is.
